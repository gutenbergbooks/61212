</div>

<p class='c009'><i>It is to be noticed that there is a curious sympathy
in point of error on both sides of the Atlantic, for
seventeen of the mistakes quoted in this book as being
made in the Public Schools of America appear in
similar or identical words in an Article on “Boys’
Blunders” in the</i> <span class='sc'>Cornhill Magazine</span> <i>of June,
1886, which was written by a Master in an English
Public School</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Blimber’s establishment was a great hothouse
in which there was a forcing apparatus
incessantly at work. All the boys blew before
their time. Mental green peas were produced
at Christmas and intellectual asparagus all the
year round. Mathematical gooseberries (very
sour ones) were common at untimely seasons
and from mere sprouts of bushes under
Dr. Blimber’s cultivation. Every description
of Greek and Latin vegetable was got off
the dryest twigs of boys under the frostiest
circumstances. Nature was of no consequence
at all. No matter what a young gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>was intended to bear Dr. Blimber made
him bear to pattern. But the system of
forcing was attended with its usual disadvantages.
There was not the right taste about
the premature productions and they didn’t
keep well. When poor Paul had spelt out No.
2 he found he had no idea of No. 1, fragments
whereof afterwards obtruded themselves into
No. 3 which slided into No. 4 which grafted
itself on to No. 2; so that whether twenty
Romuluses made a Remus, or a verb always
agreed with an ancient Briton, or three times
four was Taurus a bull, were open questions
with him. But however high and false the
temperature at which Dr. Blimber kept his hothouse,
the owners of the plants were always
ready to lend a helping hand at the bellows
and to stir the fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the appendix to Croker’s Boswell’s Johnson,
one finds this anecdote:</p>

<p class='c015'><cite>Cato’s Soliloquy.</cite>—One day Mrs. Gastrel set a
little girl to repeat to him [Doctor Samuel Johnson]
Cato’s Soliloquy, which she went through
very correctly. The Doctor, after a pause, asked
the child—</p>

<p class='c016'>“What was to bring Cato to an end?”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>She said it was a knife.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No, my dear, it was not so.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My aunt Polly said it was a knife.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, Aunt Polly’s knife <i>may do</i>, but it was
a <i>dagger</i>, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He then asked her the meaning of “bane and
antidote,” which she was unable to give. Mrs.
Gastrel said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“You cannot expect so young a child to know
the meaning of such words.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He then said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“My dear, how many pence are there in <i>sixpence</i>?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I cannot tell, sir,” was the half-terrified reply.</p>

<p class='c016'>On this, addressing himself to Mrs. Gastrel,
he said—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, my dear lady, can anything be more
ridiculous than to teach a child Cato’s Soliloquy,
who does not know how many pence there are
in sixpence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a lecture before the Royal Geographical
Society, Professor Ravenstein quoted the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>list of frantic questions, and said that they

<p class='c015'>Mention all the name of places in the world
derived from Julius Cæsar or Augustus Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c016'>Where are the following rivers: Pisuerga,
Sakaria, Guadalete, Jalon, Mulde?</p>

<p class='c016'>All you know of the following: Machacha,
Pilmo, Schebulos, Crivoscia, Basecs, Mancikert,
Taxhen, Citeaux, Meloria, Zutphen.</p>

<p class='c016'>The highest peaks of the Karakorum range.</p>

<p class='c016'>The number of universities in Prussia.</p>

<p class='c016'>Why are the tops of mountains continually
covered with snow [<i>sic</i>]?</p>

<p class='c016'>Name the length and breadth of the streams
of lava which issued from the Skaptar Jokul in
the eruption of 1783.</p>

<p class='c009'>That list would oversize nearly anybody’s
geographical knowledge. Isn’t it reasonably
possible that in our schools many of the questions
in all studies are several miles ahead of where
the pupil is?—that he is set to struggle with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>things that are ludicrously beyond his present
reach, hopelessly beyond his present strength?
This remark in passing, and by way of text;
now I come to what I was going to say.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have just now fallen upon a darling literary
curiosity. It is a little book, a manuscript compilation,
and the compiler sent it to me with the
request that I say whether I think it ought to be
published or not. I said Yes! but as I slowly
grow wise, I briskly grow cautious; and so, now
that the publication is imminent, it has seemed
to me that I should feel more comfortable if I
could divide up this responsibility with the public
by adding them to the court. Therefore I will
print some extracts from the book, in the hope
that they may make converts to my judgment
that the volume has merit which entitles it to
publication.</p>

<p class='c010'>As to its character. Every one has sampled
“English as She has Spoke” and “English as
She is Wrote”; this little volume furnishes us
an instructive array of examples of “English
as She is Taught”—in the public schools of—well,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>this country. The collection is made by a
teacher in those schools, and all the examples
in it are genuine; none of them have been
tampered with, or doctored in any way. From
time to time, during several years, whenever a
pupil has delivered himself of anything peculiarly
quaint or toothsome in the course of his recitations,
this teacher and her associates have
privately set that thing down in a memorandum-book;
strictly following the original, as to
grammar, construction, spelling, and all; and
the result is this literary curiosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The contents of the book consist mainly of
answers given by the boys and girls to questions,
said answers being given sometimes verbally,
sometimes in writing. The subjects touched
upon are fifteen in number: I. Etymology; II.
Grammar; III. Mathematics; IV. Geography;
V. “Original”; VI. Analysis; VII. History;
VIII. “Intellectual”; IX. Philosophy; X. Physiology;
XI. Astronomy; XII. Politics; XIII.
Music; XIV. Oratory; XV. Metaphysics.</p>

<p class='c010'>You perceive that the poor little young idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>has taken a shot at a good many kinds of game
in the course of the book. Now as to results.
Here are some quaint definitions of words. It
will be noticed that in all of these instances the
sound of the word, or the look of it on paper, has
misled the child:</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Aborigines</i>, a system of mountains.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Alias</i>, a good man in the Bible.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Amenable</i>, anything that is mean.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Assiduity</i>, state of being an acid.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Auriferous</i>, pertaining to an orifice.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Ammonia</i>, the food of the gods.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Capillary</i>, a little caterpillar.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Corniferous</i>, rocks in which fossil corn is found.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Emolument</i>, a headstone to a grave.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Equestrian</i>, one who asks questions.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Eucharist</i>, one who plays euchre.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Franchise</i>, anything belonging to the French.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Idolater</i>, a very idol person.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Ipecac</i>, a man who likes a good dinner.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Irrigate</i>, to make fun of.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Mendacious</i>, what can be mended.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span><i>Mercenary</i>, one who feels for another.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Parasite</i>, a kind of umbrella.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Parasite</i>, the murder of an infant.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Publican</i>, a man who does his prayers in public.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Tenacious</i>, ten acres of land.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is one where the phrase “publicans and
sinners” has got mixed up in the child’s mind
with politics, and the result is a definition
which takes one in a sudden and unexpected
way:</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Republican</i>, a sinner mentioned in the Bible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Also in Democratic newspapers now and then.
Here are two where the mistake has resulted
from sound assisted by remote fact:</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Plagiarist</i>, a writer of plays.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Demagogue</i>, a vessel containing beer and other
liquids.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>I cannot quite make out what it was that
misled the pupil in the following instances; it
would not seem to have been the sound of the
word, nor the look of it in print:</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Asphyxia</i>, a grumbling, fussy temper.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Quarternions</i>, a bird with a flat beak and no
bill, living in New Zealand.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Quarternions</i>, the name given to a style of art
practised by the Phœnicians.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Quarternions</i>, a religious convention held every
hundred years.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Sibilant</i>, the state of being idiotic.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Crosier</i>, a staff carried by the Deity.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the following sentences the pupil’s ear has
been deceiving him again:</p>

<p class='c015'>The marriage was illegible.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was totally dismasted with the whole performance.</p>

<p class='c016'>He enjoys riding on a philosopher.</p>

<p class='c016'>She was very quick at repertoire.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>He prayed for the waters to subsidize.</p>

<p class='c016'>The leopard is watching his sheep.</p>

<p class='c016'>They had a strawberry vestibule.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is one which—well, now, how often we
do slam right into the truth without ever suspecting
it:</p>

<p class='c015'>The men employed by the Gas Company go
round and speculate the meter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed they do, dear; and when you grow up,
many and many’s the time you will notice it in
the gas bill. In the following sentences the little
people have some information to convey, every
time; but in my case they failed to connect:
the light always went out on the keystone word:</p>

<p class='c015'>The coercion of some things is remarkable;
as bread and molasses.</p>

<p class='c016'>Her hat is contiguous because she wears it on
one side.</p>

<p class='c016'>He preached to an egregious congregation.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>The captain eliminated a bullet through the
man’s heart.</p>

<p class='c016'>You should take caution and be precarious.</p>

<p class='c016'>The supercilious girl acted with vicissitude
when the perennial time came.</p>

<p class='c009'>That last is a curiously plausible sentence;
one seems to know what it means, and yet he
knows all the time that he doesn’t. Here is an
odd (but entirely proper) use of a word, and a
most sudden descent from a lofty philosophical
altitude to a very practical and homely illustration:</p>

<p class='c015'>He should endeavour to avoid extremes—like
those of wasps and bees.</p>

<p class='c009'>And here—with “zoölogical” and “geological”
in his mind, but not ready to his tongue—the
small scholar has innocently gone and let
out a couple of secrets which ought never to have
been divulged in any circumstances:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>There are a good many donkeys in theological
gardens.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some of the best fossils are found in theological
cabinets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the head of “Grammar” the little
scholars furnish the following information:</p>

<p class='c015'>Gender is the distinguishing nouns without
regard to sex.</p>

<p class='c016'>A verb is something to eat.</p>

<p class='c016'>Adverbs should always be used as adjectives
and adjectives as adverbs.</p>

<p class='c016'>Every sentence and name of God must begin
with a caterpillar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Caterpillar” is well enough, but capital letter
would have been stricter. The following is a
brave attempt at a solution, but it failed to
liquify:</p>

<p class='c015'>When they are going to say some prose or
poetry before they say the poetry or prose they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>must put a semicolon just after the introduction
of the prose or poetry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chapter on “Mathematics” is full of fruit.
From it I take a few samples—mainly in an
unripe state.</p>

<p class='c015'>A straight line is any distance between two
places.</p>

<p class='c016'>Parallel lines are lines that can never meet
until they run together.</p>

<p class='c016'>A circle is a round straight line with a hole in
the middle.</p>

<p class='c016'>Things which are equal to each other are equal
to anything else.</p>

<p class='c016'>To find the number of square feet in a room
you multiply the room by the number of the
feet. The product is the result.</p>

<p class='c009'>Right you are. In the matter of geography
this little book is unspeakably rich. The questions
do not appear to have applied the microscope
to the subject, as did those quoted by Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>Ravenstein; still they proved plenty difficult
enough without that. These pupils did not
hunt with a microscope, they hunted with a shotgun;
this is shown by the crippled condition of
the game they brought in:</p>

<p class='c015'>America is divided into the Passiffic slope and
the Mississippi valey.</p>

<p class='c016'>North America is separated by Spain.</p>

<p class='c016'>America consists from north to south about
five hundred miles.</p>

and volcanoes.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Alaginnies are mountains in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Rocky Mountains are on the western side
of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>Cape Hateras is a vast body, of water surrounded
by land and flowing into the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mason and Dixon’s line is the Equater.</p>

<p class='c016'>One of the leading industries of the United
States is mollasses, book-covers, numbers, gas,
teaching, lumber, manufacturers, paper-making,
publishers, coal.</p>

<p class='c016'>In Austria the principal occupation is gathering
Austrich feathers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gibraltar is an island built on a rock.</p>

<p class='c016'>Russia is very cold and tyrannical.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sicily is one of the Sandwich Islands.</p>

Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chapter headed “Analysis” shows us that
the pupils in our public schools are not merely
loaded up with those showy facts about geography,
mathematics, and so on, and left in that
incomplete state; no, there’s machinery for
clarifying and expanding their minds. They are
required to take poems and analyze them, dig
out their common sense, reduce them to statistics,
and reproduce them in a luminous prose translation
which shall tell you at a glance what the
poet was trying to get at. One sample will do.
Here is a stanza from “The Lady of the Lake,”
followed by the pupil’s impressive explanation
of it.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alone, but with unbated zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>The horseman plied with scourge and steel;</div>
      <div class='line'>For jaded now and spent with toil,</div>
      <div class='line'>Embossed with foam and dark with soil,</div>
      <div class='line'>While every gasp with sobs he drew,</div>
      <div class='line'>The laboring stag strained full in view.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>The man who rode on the horse performed the
whip and an instrument made of steel alone with
strong ardor not diminishing, for, being tired
from the time passed with hard labor overworked
with anger and ignorant with weariness, while
every breath for labor he drew with cries full of
sorrow, the young deer made imperfect who
worked hard filtered in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>I see, now, that I never understood that poem
before. I have had glimpses of its meaning, in
moments when I was not as ignorant with weariness
as usual, but this is the first time the whole
spacious idea of it ever filtered in sight. If I
were a public-school pupil I would put those
other studies aside and stick to analysis; for,
after all, it is the thing to spread your mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>We come now to historical matters, historical
remains, one might say. As one turns the pages,
he is impressed with the depth to which one date
has been driven into the American child’s head—1492.
The date is there, and it is there to
stay. And it is always at hand, always deliverable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>at a moment’s notice. But the Fact that
belongs with it? That is quite another matter.
Only the date itself is familiar and sure: its vast
Fact has failed of lodgment. It would appear
that whenever you ask a public-school pupil when
a thing—anything, no matter what—happened,
and he is in doubt, he always rips out his 1492.
He applies it to everything, from the landing of
the ark to the introduction of the horse-car.
Well, after all, it is our first date, and so it is
right enough to honor it, and pay the public
schools to teach our children to honor it:</p>

<p class='c015'>George Washington was born in 1492.</p>

<p class='c016'>Washington wrote the Declaration of Independence
in 1492.</p>

<p class='c016'>St. Bartholemew was massacred in 1492.</p>

England in 1492 under Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c016'>The earth is 1492 miles in circumference.</p>

<p class='c009'>To proceed with “History”:</p>

his Country.</p>

<p class='c016'>Queen Isabella of Spain sold her watch and
chain and other millinery so that Columbus could
discover America.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Indian wars were very desecrating to the

His remains were taken to the cathedral
in Havana.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gorilla warfare was where men rode on
gorillas.</p>

<p class='c016'>John Brown was a very good insane man who
tried to get fugitives slaves into Virginia. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>captured all the inhabitants, but was finally conquered
and condemned to his death. The Confederasy
was formed by the fugitive slaves.</p>

a good many thousand years ago. His birthday

<p class='c016'>Julius Cæsar is noted for his famous telegram
dispatch I came I saw I conquered.</p>

<p class='c016'>Julius Cæsar was really a very great man. He

had to drink Shamrock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here is a fact correctly stated; and yet it is
phrased with such ingenious infelicity that it can
be depended upon to convey misinformation
every time it is uncarefully read:</p>

<p class='c015'>By the Salic law no woman or descendant of
a woman could occupy the throne.</p>

<p class='c009'>To show how far a child can travel in history
with judicious and diligent boosting in the public
school, we select the following mosaic:</p>

<p class='c015'>Abraham Lincoln was born in Wales in 1599.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>In the chapter headed “Intellectual” I find
a great number of most interesting statements.
A sample or two may be found not
amiss:</p>

<p class='c015'>Bracebridge Hall was written by Henry
Irving.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snow Bound was written by Peter Cooper.</p>

<p class='c016'>The House of the Seven Gables, was written
by Lord Bryant.</p>

<p class='c016'>Edgar A. Poe was a very curdling writer.</p>

<p class='c016'>Cotton Mather was a writer who invented the
cotten gin and wrote histories.</p>

<p class='c016'>Beowulf wrote the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ben Jonson survived Shakespeare in some
respects.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the Canterbury Tale it gives account of
King Alfred on his way to the shrine of Thomas
Bucket.</p>

<p class='c016'>Chaucer was the father of English pottery.</p>

<p class='c016'>Chaucer was a bland verse writer of the third
century.</p>

<p class='c016'>Chaucer was succeeded by H. Wads. Longfellow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>an American Writer. His writings were
chiefly prose and nearly one hundred years
elapsed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Shakspere translated the Scriptures and it was
called St. James because he did it.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the middle of the chapter I find many
pages of information concerning Shakspere’s
plays, Milton’s works, and those of Bacon, Addison,
Samuel Johnson, Fielding, Richardson,
Sterne, Smollett, De Foe, Locke, Pope, Swift,
Goldsmith, Burns, Cowper, Wordsworth, Gibbon,
Byron, Coleridge, Hood, Scott, Macaulay, George
Eliot, Dickens, Bulwer, Thackeray, Browning,
Mrs. Browning, Tennyson, and Disraeli—a fact
which shows that into the restricted stomach of
the public-school pupil is shoveled every year
the blood, bone, and viscera of a gigantic literature,
and the same is there digested and disposed
of in a most successful and characteristic and
gratifying public-school way. I have space for
but a trifling few of the results:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>Lord Byron was the son of an heiress and a
drunken man.</p>

<p class='c016'>Wm. Wordsworth wrote the Barefoot Boy and
Imitations on Immortality.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gibbon wrote a history of his travels in Italy.
This was original.</p>

<p class='c016'>George Eliot left a wife and children who
mourned greatly for his genius.</p>

<p class='c016'>George Eliot Miss Mary Evans Mrs. Cross Mrs.
Lewis was the greatest female poet unless George
Sands is made an exception of.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bulwell is considered a good writer.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sir Walter Scott Charles Bronte Alfred the
Great and Johnson were the first great novelists.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thomas Babington Makorlay graduated at
Harvard and then studied law, he was raised to
the peerage as baron in 1557 and died in 1776.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here are two or three miscellaneous facts that
may be of value, if taken in moderation:</p>

<p class='c015'>Homer’s writings are Homer’s Essays Virgil
the Aneid and Paradise lost some people say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>that these poems were not written by Homer
but by another man of the same name.</p>

<p class='c016'>A sort of sadness kind of shone in Bryant’s
poems.</p>

<p class='c016'>Holmes is a very profligate and amusing
writer.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the public-school pupil wrestles with
the political features of the Great Republic, they
throw him sometimes:</p>

<p class='c015'>A bill becomes a law when the president vetos
it.</p>

<p class='c016'>The three departments of the government is
the President rules the world, the governor rules
the State, the mayor rules the city.</p>

<p class='c016'>The first conscientious Congress met in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Contitution of the United States was
established to ensure domestic hostility.</p>

<p class='c009'>Truth crushed to earth will rise again. As
follows:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>The Constitution of the United States is that
part of the book at the end which nobody reads.</p>

<p class='c009'>And here she rises once more and untimely.
There should be a limit to public-school instruction;
it cannot be wise or well to let the young
find out everything:</p>

<p class='c015'>Congress is divided into civilized half civilized
and savage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here are some results of study in music and
oratory:</p>

<p class='c015'>An interval in music is the distance on the
keyboard from one piano to the next.</p>

<p class='c016'>A rest means you are not to sing it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Emphasis is putting more distress on one word
than another.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chapter on “Physiology” contains much
that ought not to be lost to science:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>Physillogigy is to study about your bones
stummick and vertebry.</p>

<p class='c016'>Occupations which are injurious to health are
carbolic acid gas which is impure blood.</p>

<p class='c016'>We have an upper and a lower skin. The
lower skin moves all the time and the upper skin
moves when we do.</p>

<p class='c016'>The body is mostly composed of water and
about one half is avaricious tissue.</p>

<p class='c016'>The stomach is a small pear-shaped bone
situated in the body.</p>

<p class='c016'>The gastric juice keeps the bones from creaking.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Chyle flows up the middle of the backbone
and reaches the heart where it meets the
oxygen and is purified.</p>

<p class='c016'>The salivary glands are used to salivate the
body.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the stomach starch is changed to cane sugar
and cane sugar to sugar cane.</p>

<p class='c016'>The olfactory nerve enters the cavity of the
orbit and is developed into the special sense of
hearing.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>The growth of a tooth begins in the back of
the mouth and extends to the stomach.</p>

<p class='c016'>If we were on a railroad track and a train was
coming the train would deafen our ears so that
we couldn’t see to get off the track.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, up to this point, none of my quotations
have added flavour to the Johnsonian anecdote
at the head of this article, let us make another
attempt:</p>

<p class='c015'>The theory that intuitive truths are discovered
by the light of nature originated from St. John’s
interpretation of a passage in the Gospel of Plato.</p>

<p class='c016'>The weight of the earth is found by comparing
a mass of known lead with that of a mass of unknown
lead.</p>

<p class='c016'>To find the weight of the earth take the length
of a degree on a meridian and multiply by 62½
pounds.</p>

<p class='c016'>The spheres are to each other as the squares
of their homologous sides.</p>

<p class='c016'>A body will go just as far in the first second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span>as the body will go plus the force of gravity and
that’s equal to twice what the body will go.</p>

<p class='c016'>Specific gravity is the weight to be compared
weight of an equal volume of or that is the weight
of a body compared with the weight of an equal
volume.</p>

<p class='c016'>The law of fluid pressure divide the different
forms of organized bodies by the form of attraction
and the number increased will be the form.</p>

<p class='c016'>Inertia is that proberty of bodies by virtue of
which it cannot change its own condition of rest
or motion. In other words it is the negative
quality of passiveness either in recoverable
latency or insipient latescence.</p>

<p class='c009'>If a laugh is fair here, not the struggling
child, but the unintelligent teacher—or rather
the unintelligent Boards, Committees, and Trustees—are
the proper target for it. All through
this little book one detects the signs of a certain
probable fact—that a large part of the pupil’s
“instruction” consists in cramming him with
obscure and wordy “rules” which he does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix'>xxxix</span>understand, and has no time to understand.
It would be as useful to cram him with brickbats;
they would at least stay. In a town
in the interior of New York, a few years ago,
a gentleman set forth a mathematical problem
and proposed to give a prize to every
public-school pupil who should furnish the correct
solution of it. Twenty-two of the brightest
boys in the public schools entered the contest.
The problem was not a very difficult one for
pupils of their mathematical rank and standing,
yet they all failed—by a hair—through one trifling
mistake or another. Some searching questions
were asked, when it turned out that these lads
were as glib as parrots with the “rules” but
could not reason out a single rule or explain
the principle underlying it. Their memories
had been stocked, but not their understandings.
It was a case of brickbat culture, pure and
simple.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are several curious “compositions” in
the little book, and we must make room for one.
It is full of naïveté, brutal truth, and unembarrassed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xl'>xl</span>directness, and is the funniest (genuine)
boy’s composition I think I have ever seen:</p>

<h3 class='c019'>ON GIRLS.</h3>

<p class='c020'>Girls are very stuckup and dignified in their
manner and be have your. They think more of
dress than anything and like to play with dowls
and rags. They cry if they see a cow in a far
distance and are afraid of guns. They stay at
home all the time and go to church on Sunday.
They are al-ways sick. They are al-ways funy
and making fun of boy’s hands and they say how
dirty. They cant play marbles. I pity them
poor things. They make fun of boys and then
turn round and love them. I don’t beleave they
ever killed a cat or anything. They look out
every nite and say oh ant the moon lovely. Thir
is one thing I have not told and that is they al-ways
now their lessons bettern boys.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Mr. Edward Channing’s recent article
in “Science”:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xli'>xli</span>The marked difference between the books now
being produced by French, English, and American
travellers, on the one hand, and German
explorers on the other, is too great to escape
attention. That difference is due entirely to the
fact that in school and university the German is
taught, in the first place to see, and in the second
place to understand what he does see.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>On Laughter.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>Laughter is something I know everybody
can do. Some people laugh until the tears
come from their eyes and then they have a
crying spell and then when that is over they
have a laughing spell. When people cry it
will make them look very peculiar so most
of people very seldom cry. It is the laughing
they generally do.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>On Occupation.</i></h3>

thing.</p>

<p class='c023'>Indians go out naked in the summer an
they take ahold of their scalp locks and cut off
the other side of their heads. They wear it on
their sides. Indians food consists of corn and
food. They use smoking instead of tanning.
They paint their skind in the color of animals.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>George Washington.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>George Washington was the first president
of the United States born in Virginia in the
year. When George was a little boy he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>never tell a lie. Because he thought it was not
nice. It tis not nice nether. He studied all
kinds of things to be a president.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>Abraham Lincoln.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>Abraham Lincoln was born in Wales in 1599.
His father was a wool-comer, but Abraham did
not like that trade. One day Abraham was
standing on the railroad and a man by the
name of Guitue came behind and shot him.
Then he got put in jail for it. But it was not
nice of him because he shot him on the railroad.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>On Reading.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>Reading makes us intelligent; and learn
about things we would otherwise hear nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is pleasant to recapitulate stories to persons
who probably have not had the opportunity
of reading them and it therefore passes
many a dreary hour away and makes many a
person renew his happiness by hoping for such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>a favorable end as some characters as are
described in the book.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If we did not have the capacity of reading
we might wait all our lives and never secure
the desired information, but if instead of waiting
for some one to tell us we take the book or
paper or whatever it might happen to be and
read it for ourselves we will be much better
satisfied and also have the consolation of knowing
we discovered it for ourselves and did not
have to wait for other people to come and furnish
us with the desired information.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In reading there is a large amount of knowledge
attained for it enlarged the mind while
reading and continues until we pass away.</p>

<p class='c010'>When we read we come across words that
when we hear them spoken of we are entirely
ignorant of them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The untutored mind is often surprisingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>expanded in reading for only a short while a
little every day. Then when we hear certain
subjects spoken of we do not wonder what it
all means.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Reading the talents of others helps us to
compose something that may help us in future
life. Without reading we should not know
any thing about our forefathers or how we came
to be civilized. What would we know about
religion if we did not read our Bible and find
out how religion originated?</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>On Girls.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>Girls are very stuckup and dignefied in their
maner and behaveyour. They think more of
dress than any thing and like to play with dowls
and rags. They cry if they see a cow in afar
distance and are afraid of guns. They stay at
home all the time and go to Church every
Sunday. They are al-ways sick. They are
al-ways funy and making fun of boys hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and they say how dirty. They cant play marbels.
I pity them poor things. They make
fun of boys and then turn round and love them.
I dont beleave they ever kiled a cat or any
thing. They look out every nite and say oh
ant the moon lovely. Thir is one thing I have
not told and that is they always now their lessons
bettern boys.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>On Timidity of Women.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>Timidity is a disease very prevelent among
our American women. It is thought by them
to be an ornament to their charms.</p>

<p class='c010'>How many young women faint by the sudden
appearance of a rat from its hideing place.
Oh! they do declare it’s impossible to live
where these dreadful creatures make their
homes they ask Ma cant she and wont she
please to try to secure some remedy so they
can be destroyed. You will see the young
ladies leap up over stones and steps of great
height so as to escape the barks of the dog, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>they are walking with a friend of the male kind
they will cling to the masculine arm and
beseach him to walk so that she might loose
sight of that horrible creature known as a
dog.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do think their cases of timidity that cannot
be governed such as cases of intemperance
fighting and death. We dont want to see any
man come along the street destitute of reasoning
and come reeling suddenly by you. Also
the expectation of death when we see a
loved sister going away from a cherished
circle.</p>

<p class='c010'>It cannot be endured, but I have no objections
for these cases but the preceding ones are
ridiculous and I beseach you to reject it remembering
you shall have to undergo greater trials
than those related.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>On Poverty.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>How many persons possess it! They are
persons whose poverty cannot be endured they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>had enjoyed preceding years in wealth and by
some mishap in the family they became poor
and how can they endeavor to forget that time
when their happiness could not be expressed
but now their troubles shall be discovered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poverty is a case that cannot be hidden it
must be let known so that the possessors may
obtain condolence in some way. Places for
poor persons are not of much importance
for the care of them is not worth mentioning.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some poor persons with a great deal of poverty
would rather walk from house to house in
search of some nourishment than inhabit those
institutions but what a number of times they
are driven from the door with the contemptuousness
of the rich how many slang words are
said to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>If our comfortable friends should remember
those persons casting away food raiment and
apparel they would be less cases of poverty
and when sickness overtakes such persons lend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>a helping hand their consciences would less
smite them.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>On Politeness.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>Politeness is to say and do the kindest way.
I think it is easier for girls to be polite than for
boys, but I am not sure as I have never been a
girl. Politeness is used in all parts of the
United States.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><i>On the Play of Hamlet.</i></h3>

<p class='c023'>Hamlet was a young man very nervous.
He was always dressed in black because his
uncle had killed his father by shooting him in
his ear. He could not go to the theatre
because his father was dead so he had the actors
come to his house and play in the front parlor
and he learned them to say the words because
he thought he knew best how to say them.
And then he thought he’d kill the king but he
didn’t. Hamlet liked Ophelia. He thought
she was a very nice girl but he didn’t marry her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>because she was going to be a nunnery. Hamlet
went to England but he did not like it very
much so he came home. Then he jumped
into Ophelia’s grave and fought a duel with
her brother. Then he died.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Hamlet was exceedingly sensitiveness. He
denunciated his mother because she entered
the matrimonial condition and showed her
two photographs which he said one was Hesperus
and one a satire. He made her experience
great regret. He was engaged to Orphelia
but had to neglect her as he was obliged to
give his attentions to revenging his father’s
death. His uncle was the murderer of his
father, Hamlet’s father. He had a very mournful
existence and was a great philosopher.</p>
